Title: Gårdsbutikker: farmshop directory + submissions

Body:
Adds a Gårdsbutikker (farm shops) directory to the Pages site and the
infrastructure to collect moderated submissions via GitHub issues.

What this includes:
- `docs/gardsbutikker.html` and supporting JS for map/search/routing (client-side)
- `docs/data/farmshops.example.json` (seed data)
- `tools/fetch_farmshops.py` (Overpass fetcher) and scheduled workflow
- `tools/append_issue_to_data.py` parser + `tools/tests/test_append_issue_to_data.py`
- CI: `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml` (pytest for tools)
- Scheduled update: `.github/workflows/fetch_farmshops.yml` (creates PR with updated data)

Notes for reviewer:
- This branch was cleaned to move large artifacts to Git LFS.
- Tests for the parser live under `tools/tests` and pass locally.
- CI will run `pytest` for the `tools` directory; PyYAML is not required for local tests
  (the parser falls back to a simple YAML-ish loader) but the workflow installs
  PyYAML for full parsing on GitHub Actions.

How to review:
1. Inspect `docs/` pages and `docs/js/gardsbutikker.js` for client behavior.
2. Check `tools/append_issue_to_data.py` and `tools/tests/test_append_issue_to_data.py`.
3. Confirm `.github/workflows/fetch_farmshops.yml` schedule and PR behavior.
